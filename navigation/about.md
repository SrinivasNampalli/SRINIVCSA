<h1>About Srinivas Nampalli</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Srinivas Nampalli. I love cars, motorsports, and playing video games. I am currently using Android Studio and working towards becoming a software engineer focused on app development.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm also a huge fan of soccer, supporting teams like PSG and Chelsea. I have a strong interest in investing in stocks and learning more about the money market. Additionally, I'm saving up to buy a dirtbike in the near future!</p>

<h2>Video Game, Family, and Sports</h2>
<p>I love watching and playing different sports that I found fun.</p>

<p>My mother told me that I have Danish, English, and Irish heritage, and I have been looking into my family tree. My family is pretty big: I have been married twice, and my first wife passed away. We have had 5 kids, 4 adopted by me and 1 biological, and we are also blessed with three grandkids. My grandkids call me "Abuelito."</p>

<p>The gallery below showcases some of my family, culture, and fun memories.</p>

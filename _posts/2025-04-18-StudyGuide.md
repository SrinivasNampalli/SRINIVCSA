 Strengths & Areas for Growth
1. Methods
Current Understanding: I have a foundational grasp of method structures, including defining and invoking methods.

Areas for Improvement:

Deepening my understanding of method logic and flow.

Practicing method overloading and parameter passing.

Action Plan: Work on exercises that involve writing and tracing methods to enhance logical reasoning.

2. Classes & Inheritance
Current Understanding: Familiar with basic class structures and the concept of inheritance.

Areas for Improvement:

Clarifying the relationship between parent and child classes.

Avoiding overcomplication in method calls within class hierarchies.

Action Plan: Review and implement examples of inheritance, focusing on method overriding and the use of super.

3. ArrayLists
Current Understanding: Comfortable with basic operations like adding and retrieving elements using .add() and .get(i).

Areas for Improvement:

Exploring more advanced methods such as .set(), .remove(), and .contains().

Understanding the implications of modifying ArrayLists during iteration.

Action Plan: Solve problems that require dynamic manipulation of ArrayLists to build proficiency.

4. Nested Loops & 2D Arrays
Current Understanding: Basic comprehension of loop structures.

Areas for Improvement:

Managing complexity when dealing with nested loops.

Accurately accessing and comparing elements within 2D arrays.

Action Plan: Practice tracing nested loops and performing operations on 2D arrays to improve accuracy and confidence.

ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts to Review
Method Overloading and Overriding: Understanding differences and appropriate use cases.

Inheritance Hierarchies: Navigating class relationships and method access.

ArrayList Methods: Mastering a variety of operations beyond basic usage.

Nested Loop Logic: Developing strategies for managing and simplifying complex loop structures.

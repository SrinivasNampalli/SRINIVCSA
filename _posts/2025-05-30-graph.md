# A* Algorithm Homework Answers

## 1. Short Problem: A* on the Given Graph

### Graph Recap

```
      (A)
     /   \
   2/     \4
   /       \
 (B) —3— (C)
   \       /
   5\     /1
     \   /
      (D)
```

- **Edge weights:**
  - A–B = 2
  - A–C = 4
  - B–C = 3
  - B–D = 5
  - C–D = 1
- **Heuristic h(n) (to D):**
  - h(A) = 6
  - h(B) = 4
  - h(C) = 2
  - h(D) = 0

### Step-by-Step A* Search from A to D

#### **Initialization**
- Start at A: g(A) = 0, h(A) = 6, f(A) = 6
- Open set: {A}
- Closed set: {}

#### **Step 1: Expand A**
- Remove A from open set, add to closed set.
- Neighbors: B and C

  - **B:**
    - g(B) = g(A) + cost(A,B) = 0 + 2 = 2
    - h(B) = 4
    - f(B) = 2 + 4 = 6
  - **C:**
    - g(C) = g(A) + cost(A,C) = 0 + 4 = 4
    - h(C) = 2
    - f(C) = 4 + 2 = 6

- Open set: {B (f=6), C (f=6)}

#### **Step 2: Expand B** (tie, pick B)
- Remove B from open set, add to closed set.
- Neighbors: C, D

  - **C:**
    - g(C) via B = g(B) + cost(B,C) = 2 + 3 = 5 (current g(C) = 4, so do not update)
  - **D:**
    - g(D) = g(B) + cost(B,D) = 2 + 5 = 7
    - h(D) = 0
    - f(D) = 7 + 0 = 7

- Open set: {C (f=6), D (f=7)}

#### **Step 3: Expand C**
- Remove C from open set, add to closed set.
- Neighbors: D

  - **D:**
    - g(D) via C = g(C) + cost(C,D) = 4 + 1 = 5 (better than previous g(D)=7, so update)
    - h(D) = 0
    - f(D) = 5 + 0 = 5

- Open set: {D (f=5), D (f=7) [remove duplicate, keep lower g]}
- Only D (f=5) remains.

#### **Step 4: Expand D**
- D is the goal. Path found!

### **Path Reconstruction**
- D reached from C, C from A.
- Path: A → C → D
- Total cost: g(D) = 5

### **Summary Table**
| Step | Node | g(n) | h(n) | f(n) | Notes |
|------|------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1    | B    | 2    | 4    | 6    | From A |
| 1    | C    | 4    | 2    | 6    | From A |
| 2    | D    | 7    | 0    | 7    | From B |
| 3    | D    | 5    | 0    | 5    | From C (better) |

**Final shortest path:** `A → C → D` with total cost **5**

**3. On a 4‑connected grid (no diagonal moves), which of these is an admissible heuristic for pathfinding?**
- **B. Manhattan distance**

**4. Which of the following is a drawback of Greedy Best‑First Search compared to A*?**

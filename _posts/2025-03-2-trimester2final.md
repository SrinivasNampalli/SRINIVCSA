                I had a burndown list, and me, Nitin, Adityadocumented our progress and updates on our features as we were working on the same thing (Student Tables).
                I added new features to make our project feel more updated and actually have a impactful change. 
                I even worked on both thymeleaf frontend and the hard backend so Im happy to understand how they work together. 
                However, In retrospect I realize I could have taken advantage of our projectg and made it much more indepth and functional. Maybe even cooler.
